# Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, capturing meeting notes is more important than ever. With many organizations now relying on virtual meetings, it can be challenging to keep track of all the information discussed during a meeting. That's where MeetingBot comes in. MeetingBot is a Teams app that uses natural language processing to capture meeting notes and generate a summary of the meeting.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of building a MeetingBot app using Node.js and the Microsoft Teams SDK. We'll provide you with the code for the app and explain each step of the process along the way.

# Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few things you'll need:

* A Microsoft Teams account
* Node.js installed on your computer
* An IDE for writing and editing code (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

# Getting Started

To get started, create a new Node.js project and install the Microsoft Teams SDK using the following command:

```powershell
npm install microsoft-teams-library-js
```

Once the SDK is installed, you can create a new `MeetingBot` class that extends the `TeamsActivityHandler` class from the SDK. This class will handle incoming messages and generate meeting summaries.

```javascript

class MeetingBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
      const message = context.activity.text;
      const notes = this.getMeetingNotes(message);

      if (notes.length > 0) {
        await this.generateMeetingSummary(notes, context);
      }

      await next();
    });
  }

  async generateMeetingSummary(notes, context) {
    // Use summarization algorithms to generate a meeting summary from the notes
    // Create a message with the summary and send it back to the channel
    const summary = this.summarizeMeeting(notes);
    const summaryMessage = MessageFactory.text(summary);
    await context.sendActivity(summaryMessage);
  }

  getMeetingNotes(message) {
    // Use natural language processing to extract meeting notes from the message
    // Return the notes as an array of strings
  }

  summarizeMeeting(notes) {
    // Use summarization algorithms to generate a meeting summary from the notes
    // Return the summary as a string
  }
}
```

The `MeetingBot` class contains three methods: `onMessage`, `generateMeetingSummary`, and `getMeetingNotes`. The `onMessage` method is called whenever a message is received in the Teams channel. The `generateMeetingSummary` method generates a meeting summary from the notes and sends it back to the channel. The `getMeetingNotes` method extracts the meeting notes from the message using natural language processing.

# Extracting Meeting Notes

To extract meeting notes from the message, we'll use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for Node.js. First, install the library using the following command:

```powershell
npm install nltk
```

Then, you can use the `tokenize` and `posTag` functions from NLTK to extract the meeting notes. The `tokenize` function splits the message into individual words, and the `posTag` function identifies the parts of speech for each word. We'll filter out any words that are not nouns or verbs, as they are less likely to be relevant to the meeting.

```javascript
const nltk = require('nltk')
const { tokenize } = nltk.tokenize

class MeetingBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
  constructor () {
    super()

    this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
      const message = context.activity.text
      const notes = this.getMeetingNotes(message)

      if (notes.length > 0) {
        await this.generateMeetingSummary(notes, context)
      }

      await next()
    })
  }

  async generateMeetingSummary (notes, context) {
    // Use summarization algorithms to generate a meeting summary from the notes
    // Create a message with the summary and send it back to the channel
    const summary = this.summarizeMeeting(notes)
    const summaryMessage = MessageFactory.text(summary)
    await context.sendActivity(summaryMessage)
  }

  getMeetingNotes (message) {
    // Use natural language processing to extract meeting notes from the message
    const words = tokenize(message)
    const taggedWords = nltk.posTag(words)

    const notes = taggedWords.filter(word => {
      const pos = word[1]
      return pos.startsWith('N') || pos.startsWith('V')
    })

    return notes.map(note => note[0])
  }

  summarizeMeeting (notes) {
    // Use summarization algorithms to generate a meeting summary from the notes
    // Return the summary as a string
  }
}

```

# Generating a Meeting Summary

Now that we have extracted the meeting notes, we need to generate a summary of the meeting. There are many approaches to automatic summarization, but we'll use a simple frequency-based algorithm for this example.

```javascript

class MeetingBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
      const message = context.activity.text;
      const notes = this.getMeetingNotes(message);

      if (notes.length > 0) {
        await this.generateMeetingSummary(notes, context);
      }

      await next();
    });
  }

  async generateMeetingSummary(notes, context) {
    // Use summarization algorithms to generate a meeting summary from the notes
    const wordFrequencies = {};

    notes.forEach((note) => {
      if (wordFrequencies[note]) {
        wordFrequencies[note]++;
      } else {
        wordFrequencies[note] = 1;
      }
    });

    const summary = Object.keys(wordFrequencies)
      .sort((a, b) => wordFrequencies[b] - wordFrequencies[a])
      .slice(0, 5)
      .join(' ');

    // Create a message with the summary and send it back to the channel
    const summaryMessage = MessageFactory.text(summary);
    await context.sendActivity(summaryMessage);
  }

  getMeetingNotes(message) {
    // Use natural language processing to extract meeting notes from the message
    const words = tokenize(message);
    const taggedWords = nltk.posTag(words);

    const notes = taggedWords.filter((word) => {
      const pos = word[1];
      return pos.startsWith('N') || pos.startsWith('V');
    });

    return notes.map((note) => note[0]);
  }
}

```

The `summarizeMeeting` method takes the meeting notes as input and generates a summary by counting the frequency of each word. The top 5 most frequently occurring words are used to generate the summary.

# Conclusion

The MeetingBot app we've built is a simple yet powerful tool for capturing meeting notes and generating summaries automatically. By using natural language processing and automatic summarization algorithms, we can save time and effort in manually taking notes and summarizing meetings. This app can be further improved by adding more features such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to provide more insights into the meeting. Overall, the MeetingBot app is a great example of how AI and machine learning can be used to streamline and automate various tasks in our daily lives.
